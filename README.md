# super-tia-project

**Project Description:** Turn It Around (TIA) is a nonprofit organization that provides anti-bullying resources for teachers, counselors, and students. This project is a website migration to WordPress with full redesign of the current website.

**Goals:** Here are the main goals for TIA’s website redesign:
* Feature search functionality for users to find anti-bullying resources or counselors based on location.
* Provide a clear path for students to search for resources on their own.
* Include their organization’s roadmap messaging to reach community centers, daycares, and college campuses into the homepage of the new website.
* Incorporate TIA’s updated brand identity with logo, fonts, and colors into the new site’s design.
